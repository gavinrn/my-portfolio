            <div class="text">I am 20 years old and eager to learn a lot about computer science, artificial
                intelligence, and the structure
                of the web. I took AP Computer Science in high school and passed
                the AP test, I took a few computer science classes at Santa Barbara City College and Pasadena City
                College,
                however I am still a novice.
                I also worked with Jack Sayers a Research Professor of Physics
                at Cal-Tech and an employee at JPL, helping him refactor some mathmatica code to python. You can look at the project on my
                github
                profile via the "Arctic Code Vault Contributor" badge. I'm excited to collaborate with people also
                interested
                in computer science to gain learning opportunitys and help others learn as well.</div>
